Here's a README template for your **Chat App** built with the **MERN stack** and **Firebase authentication**:

```markdown
# Chat App

This **Chat App** is a real-time messaging platform built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and uses **Firebase** for authentication. Users can sign up with their email, log in, chat with others, and share media like images and files.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Sign up and log in using email and password through **Firebase Authentication**.
  - Secure login with JWT (if you’re using custom backend authentication).

- **Real-Time Chat**:
  - Real-time messaging between users with updates on new messages using **Socket.io**.
  - Display recent messages in a chat window.

- **Media Sharing**:
  - Users can send images and files within the chat.

- **User Profiles**:
  - Each user has a profile that can display their name and email.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The app is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using **React** and **CSS**.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ChatApp
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies (assuming you're using `npm`):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables for Firebase (e.g., API keys) and your backend (e.g., MongoDB URI) in `.env` files.

6. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

7. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

The website should now be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.
